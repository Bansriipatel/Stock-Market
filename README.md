# Stock-Market Analysis and PredictionÂ using Neural Network

## Description
The project aims to develop a neural network-based system for stock market analysis and prediction. The system will be designed to analyze historical market data, financial reports, and other relevant information to identify market trends and predict future stock prices.

The system will be built using Python programming language, and will utilize various Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and NumPy. The system will include various features and indicators such as moving averages, trading volumes, and technical analysis indicators to predict the stock prices.

The project will involve collecting and preprocessing data from various sources, extracting relevant features, developing and training the neural network model, evaluating and validating the model's performance, and deploying the system for real-world use. The project will be executed using an Agile methodology, with regular meetings and progress updates to ensure that the project is on track and meeting the client's needs.

The end result of the project will be a reliable and accurate system for stock market analysis and prediction, which can be used by traders and investors to make informed decisions about buying and selling stocks. The system will be designed to be scalable and adaptable, so it can be updated with new data and features as needed to ensure its continued accuracy and usefulness.
